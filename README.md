# Languagebuddy

Language Buddy was created for two specific purposes.
1. Display a map of all the nearby meetups in my location for the languages I am currently studying.
2. Serve as a place where I write my current study methods for these languages, and post relevant links.

## To Do
**Map**
*Meetup API - return nearby events of groups that I am in
*Google Maps - using coordinates from Meetup API, create markers
*Google Maps - POST current location and application regenerate markers
*Google Maps - Upon clicking a marker provide some sort of directions(?)
**Resources**
